\textit{The rapid growth of technology has created a significant impact across various sectors, including the corporate environment. One of its applications in the human resource field is the Human Resource Information System (HRIS), which is designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness in managing employees. PT Visi Karya Nusantara developed an HRIS to digitalize key processes, particularly contract management, payroll components, and event scheduling. The system is built using ReactJS TypeScript on the frontend and ExpressJS on the backend. The features developed include the Contract, Payroll System, Attendance, and Event modules. The HRIS has now become a product and is currently in the production stage, allowing clients to use it in their daily operational activities. In the future, the system is expected to continue evolving to support product improvements and sustainably meet client needs.}
